# Interdude

A web app for mock interviews

## Description

There is a massive demand for a service that can allow 4th year students take mock personal
interviews. However, there is no online service that can take your mock personal interview.
Interdude allows you to get a technical mock test done online. Interdude will make pairs of
candidates and then allow them to take each otherâ€™s mock interview. The candidates do not
need to make the questions, the app will provide it. All they need to do is, rate each other
and voila! you have your tech interview practice on point.
